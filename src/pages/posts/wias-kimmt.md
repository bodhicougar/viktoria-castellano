"Laughter must be saved"

This play is about the family Hase, who lives in precarious circumstances. No money, no work but at least with a mother who keeps it all together by having a big mouth and an even bigger heart. 

The youngest, who is actually an alien, is sent to earth to save humanity, the eldest is almost a doctor and the three other siblings already have left the house. 

Then, out of nowhere, everything that could possibly go worng, goes wrong. The three siblings have to come back home, in an one and a half room apartment for the whole family. The family is now  confronted with failed weddings, the state police who is searching for the sons and a lonely neighbor, who demands company and attention. 

It is understandable that a mother can loose her nerves in such a situation but she never looses her humor and certainly not her values. 

This insane play swings like life itself between being wonderfully silly and profound. 

Is humanity woth being saved?
